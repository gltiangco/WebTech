    <h3><span class="greenbg"><a name="top">About Babson</a></span></h3>
    <p><!-- This is the second paragraph -->
     <span class = "babo"> Babson</span> College is a private business school in Wellesley, Massachusetts,
      established in 1919. Its central focus is on entrepreneurship education, and it is often ranked the most
      prestigious entrepreneurship college in the United States.
    </p>

    <p> <!-- This is the third paragraph -->
      It was founded by Roger W. Babson as an all-male business institute. Now co-ed,  <span class = "babo"> Babson</span> College offers
      bachelor's degrees in business administration and undergraduate students have the opportunity to declare
      concentrations in more than twenty seven areas of study. Through Babson's F. W. Olin Graduate School of
      Business, the college also offers master's degrees in business administration, finance, accounting,
      entrepreneurial leadership and management. Often referred to as the "Entrepreneur's College", Babson is
      renowned for immersing its students in the entrepreneurial lifestyle and culture.  <span class = "babo"> Babson </span>is also notable for
      its Foundations of Management and Entrepreneurship course, in which every enrolled first-year student
      starts, runs and dissolves a company. Babson currently offers undergraduates
      nearly sixty
      entrepreneurship-related courses. These courses are taught in tandem with various traditional liberal arts
      courses, which represent over 60% of the typical student's schedule. Every entrepreneurship course at Babson
      is taught by professors who have either started, sold, bought, or run successful businesses. Babson is
      considered very selective and currently has an undergraduate acceptance rate of 24%.

      Babson second on its 2015 list of best colleges and universities in outperforming earnings expectations.
